To see this project click [HERE](https://kyeung36220.github.io/weather-app/).

A project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app) where we made a Weather App using , APIs, Webpacks, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Cool Features
- Searching Weather in Cities: Can search for any city in the world and the website will pop up what the weather is right now.
- Different Graphics Based on Time and Weather: The background will be darker in timezones that are night time and the graphic will be different based on whether it is cloudy, rainy, snowy, or sunny!

## I own NONE of these images!
